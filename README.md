# Firewalla

Based on "Firewalla on YouTube" at https://www.youtube.com/@Firewalla/videos

Firewalla is a not-discontinued (hardware) alternative to [Fingbox](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/fing/).

## 100 - Introduction

Consider "**[Firewalla](https://firewalla.com/)**" als an alternative (hardware) for the same functionality as Fingbox once offered.

Better still, and less expensive, look into "pfSense" at https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/home-assistant-with-pfsense/
